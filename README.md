# MUI Playground

This project is a simple playground for experimenting with and building [MUI](https://mui.com/) components in a live-reloading environment.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. You can edit the components in the `src/Playground.tsx` file and see the changes live in your browser.
